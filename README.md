## `AABB-Tree: Spatial Indexing in MATLAB`

A d-dimensional `aabb-tree` implementation in <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a>.

The `AABB-TREE` toolbox provides d-dimensional `aabb-tree` construction and search for arbitrary collections of spatial objects. These tree-based indexing structures are useful when seeking to implement efficient spatial queries, reducing the complexity of intersection tests between collections of objects. Specifically, given two "well-distributed" collections `P` and `Q`, use of `aabb`-type acceleration allows the set of intersections to be computed in `O(|P|*log(|Q|))`, which is typically a significant improvement over the `O(|P|*|Q|)` operations required by "brute-force" methods. 

Given a collection of objects, an `aabb-tree` partitions the axis-aligned bounding-boxes (`AABB`'s) associated with the elements in the collection into a (binary) "tree" -- a hierarchy of "nodes" (hyper-rectangles) that each store a subset of the collection. In contrast to other geometric tree types (`quadtrees`, `kd-trees`, etc), `aabb-trees` are applicable to collections of general objects, rather than just points.

### `Quickstart`

After downloading and unzipping the current <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/aabb-tree/archive/master.zip">repository</a>, navigate to the installation directory within <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">`MATLAB`</a> / <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave">`OCTAVE`</a> and run the set of examples contained in `aabbdemo.m`:
````
aabbdemo(1); % build a tree for a 2-dimensional triangulation.
aabbdemo(2); % build a tree for a 3-dimensional triangulation.
aabbdemo(3); % compare a "fast" "aabb-accelerated" search with a "slow" brute-force computation.
